# 📝 Notes

This project was fun to make as I find making productivity apps fun. One thing to note was this was my first time working with firestore sub collections so that was cool to learn about and see why theyre useful and how it makes data fetching a lot more effecient by only fetching things you need specifically instead of having it as one doc and needing to fetch the whole thing when I dont need it.

# 📌 Future Improvement Ideas

- Team collaboration features
- Project templates
- More customization options on tasks
- Be able to add own statuses/ columns
